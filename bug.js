This error occurs when using a third-party library that is not compatible with the latest version of React Native or when using an outdated version of React Native itself. The error may manifest in different ways, depending on the library and the context. For instance, you may see a runtime error, a build error, or unexpected behavior in your app.

One common cause is conflicting versions of dependencies. Libraries often have dependencies on other libraries, and if these dependencies have conflicting version requirements, it can lead to errors. Another potential cause is using a library that hasn't been updated to support newer versions of React Native. This can cause incompatibility issues and lead to errors. For example, a library that relies on deprecated APIs or components may not work correctly in a newer React Native version.

To resolve this issue, you need to carefully examine the dependencies of your project, ensuring that all libraries are compatible with your React Native version. Consider updating your project to the latest version of React Native and its compatible libraries. If upgrading is not feasible, consult the documentation of the third-party library for compatibility information and potential workarounds. You might need to downgrade or use alternative libraries.
