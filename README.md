# Uncommon React Native Errors from Third-Party Libraries

This repository demonstrates an example of uncommon errors encountered in React Native applications, specifically those arising from incompatibilities between third-party libraries and the React Native version, or conflicts among dependencies.

## Problem Description

The `bug.js` file shows a scenario where an outdated or incompatible third-party library causes unexpected behavior or errors within a React Native application. This could manifest as runtime errors, build failures, or unexpected behavior.  The exact error will vary depending on the specific library and the version mismatch.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file presents a solution by carefully examining the application's dependencies, ensuring all libraries are compatible with the current React Native version.  The solution may involve updating dependencies to their latest compatible versions or, if not feasible, finding alternative libraries that are compatible.
